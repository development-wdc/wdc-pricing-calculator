            <p>During the 2010 Haiti earthquake, widespread displacement led to a surge in gender-based violence (GBV) in overcrowded camps. Women and girls faced heightened risks of sexual assault, with over 250 cases reported in the first months post-disaster (UN Women, 2010).</p>
            <p>The crisis displaced 1.5 million people (International Organization for Migration, 2010), and GBV worsened trauma, eroded community trust, and stalled recovery. Without safe spaces and legal support, survivors remained at risk, facing lasting psychological and social harm.</p>
            <p>GBV surges in crises, affecting 1 in 5 women in humanitarian settings (World Health Organization, 2021). Without targeted action, survivors endure ongoing threats, and communities struggle to restore stability.</p>
            <p>The World Disaster Center (WDC) is capable of establishing mobile safe spaces equipped with AI-powered risk assessment tools during crises. Its blockchain-based reporting system enables secure, anonymous reporting of GBV cases, with the capacity to provide psychosocial support and legal aid to up to 10,000 women daily. Unlike other organizations, WDC’s real-time data integration can reduce response times by up to 80% (Danish Refugee Council Report, 2025), empowering communities to prevent and eliminate GBV incidents.
